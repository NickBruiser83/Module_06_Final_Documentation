          <h2> Description of the purpose of the site</h2>
          </div>
          <p> The purpose of scaredyet.com is to display the top horror movies in a few subcategories. The user will navigate the site using the menu to access the voting category or the dropdowns for either the top 10 for Sci/fi or Drama horror.
             When users select one of the top 10 options, they will be brought to a page with ten links ranked 1 - 10 of the best horror movies in that subgenre. The links take the user to youtube, where they can watch the
             trailer for the film. The last option in the main menu is the vote button. The vote button will take the user to a page with several entry fields to enter their name, number, email, and favorite movie. After submitting the details, the user
             is taken to a page showing all the favorites saved to their local computer.
